The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at the end of each reporting period. Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Any asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within other gains/(losses) in profit or loss.

### Impairment of Non-Financial Assets

At the end of each reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.  
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Fair value less costs to sell is determined as the amount obtainable from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties, less the costs of disposal.  
In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in profit or loss.

### Intangible Assets (Computer Software)

Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring the specific software to use. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of three to five years.

### 3.5 Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of individual items of inventory are determined using the weighted average costs. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads, based on normal operating capacity. It excludes borrowing costs.  
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Spare parts are generally treated as inventories. As they are usually used for maintenance and repairs, their cost is expensed when used. However, there are exceptions where:
