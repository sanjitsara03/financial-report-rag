## Interest rate risk

The sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk shows how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market rates at the reporting date.

## Credit risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. Trade and other receivables are mainly derived from sales to customers and amount due from related parties. The Company does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk. The Company applies the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for trade receivables. The expected credit losses also incorporate forward looking information.

Trade and other receivables consist of invoiced amounts from normal trading activities and amount due from related parties. Strict credit control is exercised through monitoring of cash received from customers and other parties and, when necessary, provision is made for specific doubtful accounts.

As at 31 December 2024, management was unaware of any significant unprovided credit risk (2023: Nil)

The Company manages credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents by transacting banking business with only financial institutions licensed by the Bank of Ghana.
