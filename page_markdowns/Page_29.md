## Financial Assets and Liabilities

### Financial Assets

#### Classification

The Company has one type of financial asset that is subject to the expected credit loss model, which are trade receivables from contracts with customers. The Company classifies its financial assets as "financial assets measured at amortised cost".

Financial instruments are classified as "financial assets at amortised cost" when both criteria outlined below are met:

- The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows; and
- The contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.

#### Recognition and Derecognition

Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date, the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets expire or are transferred and the Company transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

#### Measurement

At initial recognition, the Company measures its financial asset at its fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.

Subsequent to initial recognition, these assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in profit or loss.

#### Offsetting Financial Instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

#### Impairment of Financial Assets

The Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its assets carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

For trade receivables only, the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor's credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.

The Company recognises a 100% impairment loss on receivables exceeding 180 days. The Company's expected loss rates used in calculating impairment losses are based on the payment profiles of sales customers and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

While cash and cash equivalents and amounts due from related parties are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, there was no identified material impairment loss.
