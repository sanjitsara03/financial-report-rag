### Non-derivative financial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.

The Company discloses the fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
- Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and
- Level 3 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, no observable inputs).

The carrying value of the companyâ€™s financial assets and liabilities approximates its fair value.
