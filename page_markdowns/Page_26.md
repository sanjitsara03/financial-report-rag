## Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement

The amendments clarify that the past service cost (or the gain or loss on settlement) is calculated by measuring the defined benefit liability (asset) using updated assumptions and comparing benefits offered and plan assets before and after the plan amendment (or curtailment or settlement) but ignoring the effect of the asset ceiling (that may arise when the defined benefit plan is in a surplus position). IAS 19 is now clear that the change in the effect of the asset ceiling that may result from the plan amendment (or curtailment or settlement) is determined in a second step and is recognised in the normal manner in other comprehensive income.

The paragraphs that relate to measuring the current service cost and the net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) have also been amended. The Company will now be required to use the updated assumptions from this remeasurement to determine current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the reporting period after the change to the plan. In the case of the net interest, the amendments make it clear that for the period post plan amendment, the net interest is calculated by multiplying the net defined benefit liability (asset) as remeasured under IAS 19 with the discount rate used in the remeasurement (also taking into account the effect of contributions and benefit payments on the net defined benefit liability (asset)).

## IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments

IFRIC 23 sets out how to determine the accounting tax position when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The Interpretation requires the Company to:

- Determine whether uncertain tax positions are assessed separately or as a Company; and
- Assess whether it is probable that a tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment used, or proposed to be used, by an entity in its income tax filings:

If yes, the Company should determine its accounting tax position consistently with the tax treatment used or planned to be used in its income tax filings.

If no, the Company should reflect the effect of uncertainty in determining its accounting tax position using either the most likely amount or the expected value method.

## New and revised IFRS Standards in issue but not yet effective

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Company has not applied the following new and revised IFRS Standards that have been issued but are not yet effective.

### Amendment to IAS 21 Lack of Exchangeability (Effective from 1 January 2025)

The Amendments introduce requirements to assess when a currency is exchangeable into another currency and when it is not. The Amendments require an entity to estimate the spot exchange rate when it concludes that a currency is not exchangeable into another currency. IAS 21, prior to the Amendments, did not include explicit requirements for the determination of the exchange rate when a currency is not exchangeable into another currency, which led to diversity in practice.

### Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments (Effective from 1 January 2026)

The Amendments permit an entity to early adopt only the amendments related to the classification of financial assets and the related disclosures and apply the remaining amendments later. This would be particularly useful to entities that wish to apply the Amendments early for financial instruments with ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance)-linked or similar features.

The Amendments may significantly affect how entities account for the derecognition of financial liabilities and how financial assets are classified.

### IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (Effective from 1 January 2027)

The aim of the IASB in publishing IFRS 18 is to improve comparability and transparency of companiesâ€™ performance reporting. IFRS 18 has also resulted in narrow changes to the statement of cash flows. It sets out significant new requirements for how financial statements are presented, with particular focus on:
