## 3.17 Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

## 3.18 Segment Reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker is responsible for the allocation of resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.

## 3.19 Contingent Liabilities

Contingent liabilities are potential liabilities that arise from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only on the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events which are not wholly within the control of the Company. Provisions for liabilities are recorded when a loss is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated.

The amount is determined as the potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Company could be required to make if an adverse decision occurs against the Company.

## 3.20 Leases

The Company leases one warehouse and entered into a non-cancellable lease agreement with a transport service limited in June 2022. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 5 years but may have extension options. Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Company allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. However, for leases of real estate for which the Company is a lessee, it has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components and instead accounts for these as a single lease component. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interests in the leased assets that are held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:

- fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable
- Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the liability. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Company where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, adjusted to reflect changes in financing conditions since third party financing was received.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

- the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
- any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received.
- any initial direct costs, and
