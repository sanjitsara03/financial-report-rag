The directors, in submitting to the shareholders their report and financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2024, report as follows:

### STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES

The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements, and other explanatory notes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants Ghana (ICAG) mandated by the ICAG Act, 2020 (Act 1058), and in a manner required by the Companies Act, 2019 (Act 992), and other national regulations, where appropriate.

In preparing these financial statements, the Directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have been used and consistently applied; and that judgements and estimates made, are reasonable and prudent and comply with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act, 2019 (Act 992).

The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the company keeps accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the company. They are also responsible for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the company complies with the laws and regulations applicable to its activities and for establishing arrangements designed to prevent any non-compliance with laws and regulations and to detect any that may occur.  
The above statements which should be read in conjunction with the auditor’s report set out on pages 10 to 16 are made with a view to distinguishing the respective responsibilities of the Directors and the Auditor in relation to these financial statements to the shareholders.

The Directors have made an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and have no reason to believe the business will not be a going concern.

### GOING CONCERN

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue to operate into the foreseeable future. This means in particular that the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the statement of financial position assume no intention or the necessity to either liquidate the Company or curtail significantly the scale of its operations. It further presumes that funds will be available to finance activities of the Company and that the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities, contingent obligations and commitments will occur in the ordinary course of business.

### FINANCIAL RESULTS

The results for the year are as set out in the statement of comprehensive income on page 17 to 20 of the financial statements.

### ORDINARY DIVIDEND

The directors recommend payment of a dividend of GH₵9.3m (GH₵0.08 per share) for the year ended 31 December 2024 (2023: GH₵5.8m (GH₵0.05 per share)).
