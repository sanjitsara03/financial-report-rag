## 32. Capital risk management

Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Heads of Department. These reports are used to make strategic decisions. The Company considers the business from a product perspective.

The reportable operating segments derive their revenue from the manufacture and distribution of dairy products, fruit drinks and Plant Based Milk. Ninety-six percent of the Company's revenue is derived from sale of dairy products and the remaining four percent is derived from sale of fruit drinks and plant-based milk. Management considers the products to have similar economic characteristics, and they have therefore been aggregated into a single operating segment.
