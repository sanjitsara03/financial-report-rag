## 4.5 Leases

### Critical Judgment in Determining the Lease Term

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). For lease of the warehouses the following factors are normally the most relevant:
- If there are significant penalties to terminate (or not extend), the Company is typically reasonably certain to extend (or not terminate).
- If any leasehold improvements are expected to have a significant remaining value, the Company is typically reasonably certain to extend (or not terminate).

Otherwise, the Company considers other factors including historical lease durations and the costs and business disruption required to replace the leased asset.
Extension options in warehouse have not been included in the lease liability, because the Company could replace the assets without significant cost or business disruption.
The lease term is reassessed if an option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Company becomes obliged to exercise (or not exercise) it.
The assessment of reasonable certainty is only revised if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs, which affects this assessment, and that is within the control of the lessee. During the current financial year, there was no revisions made in lease terms to exercise extension and termination options.
