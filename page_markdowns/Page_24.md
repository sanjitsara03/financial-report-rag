## Amendments to IAS 16 — Property, Plant and Equipment—Proceeds before Intended Use

The amendments prohibit deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced before that asset is available for use, i.e. proceeds while bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Consequently, an entity recognises such sales proceeds and related costs in profit or loss. The entity measures the cost of those items in accordance with IAS 2 *Inventories*. Performance of the asset is such that it is capable of being used in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes.

The amendments also clarify the meaning of ‘testing whether an asset is functioning properly’. IAS 16 now specifies this as assessing whether the technical and physical capabilities of the asset are such that it is capable of being used in the manner intended by management.

If not presented separately in the statement of comprehensive income, the financial statements shall disclose the amounts of proceeds and cost included in profit or loss that relate to items produced that are not an output of the entity’s ordinary activities, and which line item(s) in the statement of comprehensive income include(s) such proceeds and cost.

The amendments are applied retrospectively, but only to items of property, plant and equipment that are brought to the location and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements in which the entity first applies the amendments.

The entity shall recognise the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) at the beginning of that earliest period presented.

The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022, with early application permitted.

## Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of material

The amendments are intended to make the definition of material in IAS 1 easier to understand and are not intended to alter the underlying concept of materiality in IFRS Standards. The concept of ‘obscuring’ material information with immaterial information has been included as part of the new definition. The threshold for materiality influencing users has been changed from ‘could influence’ to ‘could reasonably be expected to influence’.

The definition of material in IAS 8 has been replaced by a reference to the definition of material in IAS 1. In addition, the IASB amended other Standards and the *Conceptual Framework* that contain a definition of material or refer to the term ‘material’ to ensure consistency.

The amendments are applied prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, with earlier application permitted.

## Amendments to IFRS 3 Definition of a business

The amendments clarify that while businesses usually have outputs, outputs are not required for an integrated set of activities and assets to qualify as a business. To be considered a business an acquired set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.

Additional guidance is provided that helps to determine whether a substantive process has been acquired.

The amendments introduce an optional concentration test that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. Under the optional concentration test, the acquired set of activities and assets is not a business if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or Company of similar assets.

The amendments are applied prospectively to all business combinations and asset acquisitions for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2021, with early application permitted.
