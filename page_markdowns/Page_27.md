## Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.

### 3.1 Basis of Accounting

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified to include the fair valuation of certain financial instruments to the extent required or permitted under the Company’s accounting policies and set out below:

### 3.2 Foreign Currency Transactions

The Company's foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognized in the profit and loss account.

### 3.3 Uses of Estimates and Judgements

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.

### 3.4 Property, Plant and Equipment

**Recognition**

Property, plant and equipment held for use in the production or supply of goods, or for administrative purposes are stated in the statement of financial position at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes the expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of these items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred. Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and other costs directly attributable to the completion of the assets.

**Depreciation/Amortisation**

Leasehold land is depreciated over the unexpired portion of the lease. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

- The statement of profit or loss, including requirements for mandatory sub-totals to be presented. IFRS 18 introduces requirements for items of income and expense to be classified into one of five categories in the statement of profit or loss. This classification results in certain sub-totals being presented, such as the sum of all items of income and expense in the operating category comprising the new mandatory ‘operating profit or loss’ sub-total.

Aggregation and disaggregation of information, including the introduction of overall principles for how information should be aggregated and disaggregated in financial statements.

- Disclosures related to management-defined performance measures (MPMs), which are measures of financial performance based on a total or sub-total required by IFRS Accounting Standards with adjustments made (e.g. ‘adjusted profit or loss’). Entities will be required to disclose MPMs in the financial statements with disclosures, including reconciliations of MPMs to the nearest total or sub-total calculated in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.
