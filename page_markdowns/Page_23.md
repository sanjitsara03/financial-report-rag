## Amendments to IFRS 3 – Reference to the Conceptual Framework

The amendments update IFRS 3 so that it refers to the 2018 *Conceptual Framework* instead of the 1989 *Framework*.

They also add to IFRS 3 a requirement that, for obligations within the scope of IAS 37, an acquirer applies IAS 37 to determine whether at the acquisition date a present obligation exists as a result of past events. For a levy that would be within the scope of IFRIC 21 *Levies*, the acquirer applies IFRIC 21 to determine whether the obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay the levy has occurred by the acquisition date.

Finally, the amendments add an explicit statement that an acquirer does not recognise contingent assets acquired in a business combination.

The amendments are effective for business combinations for which the date of acquisition is on or after the beginning of the first annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2023. Early application is permitted if an entity also applies all other updated references (published together with the updated *Conceptual Framework*) at the same time or earlier.

## IFRS 9 Financial Instruments - Fees in the 10% test for derecognition of Financial Liabilities

The amendment clarifies that in applying the ‘10 per cent’ test to assess whether to derecognise a financial liability, an entity includes only fees paid or received between the entity (the borrower) and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the entity or the lender on the other's behalf.

The amendment is applied prospectively to modifications and exchanges that occur on or after the date the entity first applies the amendment.

The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, with early application permitted.

## IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments) - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture

The amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 deal with situations where there is a sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. Specifically, the amendments state that gains or losses resulting from the loss of control of a subsidiary that does not contain a business in a transaction with an associate or a joint venture that is accounted for using the equity method, are recognised in the parent’s profit or loss only to the extent of the unrelated investors’ interests in that associate or joint venture. Similarly, gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of investments retained in any former subsidiary (that has become an associate or a joint venture that is accounted for using the equity method) to fair value are recognised in the former parent’s profit or loss only to the extent of the unrelated investors’ interests in the new associate or joint venture.

The effective date of the amendments has yet to be set by the IASB; however, earlier application of the amendments is permitted. The directors of the Company anticipate that the application of these amendments may have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future periods should such transactions arise.
