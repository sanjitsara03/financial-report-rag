## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF FAN MILK PLC

### Key Audit Matters (continued)

| Key Audit matters | How these matters were addressed in the audit |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Assessment of Fraud** | During our audit, we engaged management on various issues, including assessment of fraud (perceived or real). The incidence of fraud that occurred during the period under review was thus brought to our attention by management. <br><br> The matter was reported to the CID and the employee in question was arrested and interrogated by the police where he admitted committing the offence. The employee has been subsequently dismissed by the company. Currently, the case is pending trial at the Circuit Court 11. <br><br> We performed a review of controls in place over customers' supply chain (order to delivery). Even though the controls in place remain robust, we made recommendations to management that could enhance early detection and or prevention of future occurrence of such incidence. |
| A stock discrepancy between the physical stock and the balance sheet was discovered by management on the 17th July 2024 at the value of GHS 1.8 million. <br><br> Investigation carried out revealed that the difference was linked to transactions carried out by an employee in the supply chain department. <br><br> The transaction involved moving stock to a virtual location for the Tamale Regional Distribution Centre, a region where the client does not operate currently. |
