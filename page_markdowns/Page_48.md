## 

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales customers and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information. Due to the number of debtors and the credit life of receivables, management incorporates forward looking information into the impairment provisioning based on any relevant forward-looking information that is gathered on the operations of the agents and their ability to honour their obligations is communicated to the accounts receivable team.

On that basis, the loss allowance as at December 31, 2024 has been estimated as follows:

|                    | Not yet Due | 0 to 30 days | 31 to 60 days | 61 to 90 days | Above 90 days | Total  |
|--------------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------|

The Company assessed other receivables, cash and related party receivables balances to determine their expected credit losses. Based on this assessment, the identified expected credit loss was estimated at GH¢5.594 million at 31 December 2024 (2023: GH¢6.565 million).

## Liquidity Risk

The Company evaluates its ability to meet its obligations on an ongoing basis. Based on these evaluations, the Company devises strategies to manage its liquidity risk. Prudent liquidity risk management implies that sufficient cash is maintained, and that sufficient funding is available through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.

The Company places cash in interest-bearing current account to provide sufficient funding to meet its obligations. At the end of the reporting date, bank accounts, cash held on call and fixed deposit accounts was GH¢109.11 million (2022: GH¢65.92 million).
