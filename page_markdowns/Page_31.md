## 3.13 Dividends

Dividends on ordinary shares are charged to equity in the period in which they are approved by the Company's shareholders.

## 3.14 Revenue Recognition

The Company derives its revenue from the sale of goods. The Company produces and sells a range of dairy products through sales agents and other distributors. Sales are recognised when control of the products has transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer. Sales agents do not have full discretion over the price to sell the products, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the wholesaler’s acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to the specific location. The risks of obsolescence and loss are not transferred to the agents and distributors. The products are often sold with retrospective volume discounts based on aggregate monthly sales. The product disaggregation is disclosed in Note 5.

Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated volume discounts. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. All volume discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period are paid during the period. No element of financing is deemed present as sales are made with a credit term of between 8 to 45 days, which is consistent with market practice. The Company’s obligation to replace damaged or expired products under the sales terms is recognised as a provision.

## 3.15 Employee Benefits

**Pension Obligations**  
The Company operates a defined contribution pension plan. A defined contribution pension plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Company has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.

**Long service awards**  
The Company gives awards to all employees to recognise and reward members of staff for continuous and dedicated service. Employees are rewarded for period of service in excess of 10 years. Liabilities for long service awards are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service. They are therefore measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period.

## 3.16 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and...
