### 28. Financial risk management objectives and policies

#### Financial risk factors

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of risks, including financial, market (including foreign exchange and interest rate), credit and liquidity risks. The Company's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize the potential adverse effects those risks may have on its financial performance. The Company does not hedge any of its risk exposures. Risk management is carried out by management of the Company under policies approved by the board of Directors.

#### Market Risk

**Foreign exchange risk**

Foreign exchange risk arises as a result of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable balances that are denominated in foreign currency. The Company seeks to reduce its foreign exchange risk exposure through a policy of matching, as far as possible, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Company imports raw materials, spare parts and equipment from overseas and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from Euro and United States Dollar exposures.

Management is responsible for minimizing the effect of the currency exposure by holding bank accounts in foreign currencies.

If the local currency had weakened/strengthened by 10% (2023: 10%) against exposures denominated in US dollar at 31 December 2024, with all variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year and equity would have increased/decreased by GH₵354,834 (2023 GH₵1,434,111).
