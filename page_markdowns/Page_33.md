## Restoration Costs

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. Payments associated with short-term leases of buildings are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.

### Extension and Termination Options

Extension and termination options are included in the lease contract. These are used to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Company’s operations. The extension options held are solely exercisable by both the Company and the respective lessor.

## 4. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements

Estimates are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the inherent uncertainties in this evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision. In addition, estimates are subject to change as new information becomes available and changes subsequent to these estimates may significantly affect future operating results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the Company’s accounting policies.

### 4.1 Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment

Critical estimates are made by the Directors in determining depreciation rates for property, plant and equipment. The rates used are set out in note 3.4 (ii). Should the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment differ by 1% from management’s estimates, the carrying amount of the property and equipment will change by an estimated GH¢255,493 (2023: GH¢257,880) higher or lower.

### 4.2 Income Taxes

Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Company recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current income tax and deferred income tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

### 4.3 Impairment of Account Receivables

The loss allowances for financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Company uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the Company’s past history, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.

### 4.4 Employee Benefit Obligations

The present value of the employee benefit obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost include the turnover rate and inflation rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of employee benefit obligations.

The Company determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that is applied to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the employee benefit obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Company considers the interest rates of government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation. Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions.
