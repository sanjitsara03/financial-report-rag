## IFRS S2 Climate-related disclosures

IFRS S2 sets out the requirements for disclosing information about an entity’s climate-related risks and opportunities. In particular, IFRS S2 requires an entity to disclose information that enables users of general-purpose financial reports to understand:

- the governance processes, controls and procedures the entity uses to monitor, manage and oversee climate-related risks and opportunities;
- the entity’s strategy for managing climate-related risks and opportunities;
- the processes the entity uses to identify, assess, prioritise and monitor climate-related risks and opportunities, including whether and how those processes are integrated into and inform the entity’s overall risk management process; and
- the entity’s performance in relation to its climate-related risks and opportunities, including progress towards any climate-related target it has set, and any target it is required to meet by law or regulation.

## Amendment to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 Supplier Finance Arrangements

The Amendments also provide guidance on characteristics of supplier finance arrangements, the presentation requirements for liabilities and associated cash flows arising out of supply chain financing arrangements and related disclosures.

## Amendment to IFRS 16 Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback

The Amendments provide a requirement for the seller-lessee to determine ‘lease payments’ or ‘revised lease payments’ in a way that the seller-lessee would not recognise any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use retained by the seller-lessee.

## Amendment to IAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current

The amendments require that an entity’s right to defer settlement of a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period must have substance and must exist at the end of the reporting period. Classification of a liability is unaffected by the likelihood that the entity will exercise its right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting period.

## Amendment to IAS 1 Non-current Liabilities with Covenants

This is a further clarification to the initial amendment to IAS 1. If an entity’s right to defer is subject to the entity complying with specified conditions, such conditions affect whether that right exists at the end of the reporting period, if the entity is required to comply with the condition on or before the end of the reporting period and not if the entity is required to comply with the conditions after the reporting period. The amendments also provide clarification on the meaning of ‘settlement’ for the purpose of classifying a liability as current or non-current. If an entity’s right to defer is subject to the entity complying with specified conditions, such conditions affect whether that right exists at the end of the reporting period, if the entity is required to comply with the condition on or before the end of the reporting period and not if the entity is required to comply with the conditions after the reporting period.
