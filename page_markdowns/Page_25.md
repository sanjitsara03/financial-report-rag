## Consequence of COVID-19

By introducing a practical expedient to IFRS 16, the practical expedient permits a lessee to elect not to assess whether a COVID-19-related rent concession is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election shall account for any change in lease payments resulting from the COVID-19-related rent concession the same way it would account for the change applying IFRS 16 if the change were not a lease modification.

The practical expedient applies only to rent concessions occurring as a direct consequence of COVID-19 and only if all the following conditions are met:

a. The change in lease payments results in revised consideration for the lease that is substantially the same as, or less than, the consideration for the lease immediately preceding the change;

b. Any reduction in lease payments affects only payments originally due on or before 30 June 2021 (a rent concession meets this condition if it results in reduced lease payments on or before 30 June 2021 and increased lease payments that extend beyond 30 June 2021); and

c. There is no substantive change to other terms and conditions of the lease.

In the current financial year, the Company applied the amendment to IFRS 16 (as issued by the IASB in May 2021) in advance of its effective date.

## Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures

The amendment clarifies that IFRS 9, including its impairment requirements, applies to other financial instruments in an associate or joint venture to which the equity method is not applied. These include long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the entity’s net investment in an associate or joint venture. The Company applies IFRS 9 to such long-term interests before it applies IAS 28. In applying IFRS 9, the Company does not take account of any adjustments to the carrying amount of long-term interests required by IAS 28 (i.e., adjustments to the carrying amount of long-term interests arising from the allocation of losses of the investee or assessment of impairment in accordance with IAS 28).

## Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation

The amendments to IFRS 9 clarify that for the purpose of assessing whether a prepayment feature meets the ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ (SPPI) condition, the party exercising the option may pay or receive reasonable compensation for the prepayment irrespective of the reason for prepayment. In other words, financial assets with prepayment features with negative compensation do not automatically fail SPPI.

## IAS 12 Income Taxes

The amendments clarify that the Company should recognise the income tax consequences of dividends in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity according to where the Company originally recognised the transactions that generated the distributable profits. This is the case irrespective of whether different tax rates apply to distributed and undistributed profits.

## IAS 23 Borrowing Costs

The amendments clarify that if any specific borrowing remains outstanding after the related asset is ready for its intended use or sale, that borrowing becomes part of the funds that an entity borrows generally when calculating the capitalisation rate on general borrowings.

## IFRS 3 Business Combinations

The amendments clarify that when the Company obtains control of a business that is a joint operation, the Company applies the requirements for a business combination achieved in stages, including remeasuring its previously held interest (PHI) in the joint operation at fair value. The PHI to be remeasured includes any unrecognised assets, liabilities and goodwill relating to the joint operation.

## IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements

The amendments clarify that when a party that participates in, but does not have joint control of, a joint operation that is a business obtains joint control of such a joint operation, the Company does not remeasure its PHI in the joint operation.
