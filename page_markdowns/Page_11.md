| **Trade Terms and Rebates (Ghs115.186m)**<br><br>Sales rebates, advertising and promotion costs represent significant items and are areas of significant management judgement.<br><br>Additionally, as a result of competition and pressure from distributors, these costs may grow faster. Because of their increasing significance, proper controls over these costs are essential.<br><br>Such controls require that a detailed budget process, specific control and accounting procedures for commitments, structured and reliable authorization and follow-up procedures are established.<br><br>These procedures are generally complex, in particular due to the number of persons involved with the transactions, both externally (structure of the distribution) as well as internally (Sales, marketing and finance departments) and their confidentially. | - We performed control testing of the internal control over sales deductions including the controls on conditional rebates and trade support (off – invoice) that these are planned, and agreed as per specific cluster contract policy and updated in system accordingly;<br><br>- We checked that customers payments/deductions are allocated promptly to the correct invoices (and payable/credit notes where applicable);<br><br>- We performed tests related to sales cut-off at year end;<br><br>- We performed substantive testing on the accuracy and appropriateness of customer’s deductions recorded over the period and rebate provision calculation at year end.
