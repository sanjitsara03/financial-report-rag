## 3.7 Trade Receivables

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets. Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment. The impairment provision is determined using the expected credit loss model by considering cash short falls in various default scenarios.

## 3.8 Financial Liabilities

### Initial recognition and measurement

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, minus directly attributable transaction cost. The company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables.

### Subsequent measurement of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

### Derecognition of financial liabilities

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement. For non-substantial modifications, a gain or loss is recognised at the time of the modification.

## 3.9 Trade Payables

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

## 3.10 Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.

## 3.11 Stated Capital

The proceeds of ordinary shares are classified as ‘stated capital’ in equity.

## 3.12 Taxation

The amount stated as income tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred income tax. Tax is recognised in the profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

### Current income tax

Current tax liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rate and tax laws used to compute the amount are those enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.

### Deferred income tax

Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method on all temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at year end.
